# Data Structures â€” What/When

- Arrays and Hash maps: de-dupe, frequency, sliding windows
- Linked lists: pointer practice, LRU internals
- Stacks/Queues: parsing, BFS layers
- Heaps: top-K, scheduling
- Trees/BST: ordered data, range queries
- Tries: prefix lookup, routing
- Graphs + DSU: connectivity, dependencies
- DP tables: overlapping subproblems, tabulation first
