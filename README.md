# Python DSA Roadmap (Senior/Staff Track)

Purpose: one-hour-a-day, pattern-first system to master Data Structures & Algorithms for senior/staff interviews.  
Principles: solve > memorize • implement DS from scratch • narrate tradeoffs • write tests.

## Study Cadence (60 min)

1) Warm-up 10 min — review notes + 1 micro-drill
2) Deep problem 35 min — restate → choose pattern → code → basic tests
3) Reflect & test 10 min — add edge cases; write 3 lines: worked/broke/next
4) Log 5m — update tracker, queue tomorrow’s problem

## Folders

- `notes/` Big-O, DS, algorithms, problem framework
- `checklists/` Week-by-week tick-boxes + prompts
- `tracker/` LeetCode/NeetCode progress
- `snippets/` reusable templates (window, DSU, etc.)
- `src/` solutions by week; `tests/` unit tests
- `visuals/` dependency map, pattern flow, Big-O cheats

## Quick Start

- Start Week 1 (Big-O + timing utility).
- Solve one problem/day (Mon–Thu), Friday review.
- Track each problem in `tracker/leetcode-progress.md`.

## Senior/Staff Angle

Explain invariants, complexity, and failure modes. Offer variants and when you'd swap data structures in production.

> Obsidian users: add this repo to your vault and use the weekly checklists.
