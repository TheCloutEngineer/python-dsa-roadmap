# Pattern Flow (When to use what)

- Window: subarray/substring with max/min constraint â†’ moving boundaries
- Two pointers: sorted arrays, pair/sum/unique in place
- Sort and Sweep: intervals, overlaps, resource minimization
- Search on Answer: "min X such that constraint holds"
- Graph + Toposort: prerequisites/dependencies
- DSU: connectivity and grouping
- DP: overlapping subproblems, optimal substructure
